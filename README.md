# GitHub Flow Demo

Use this template repository to practice GitHub Flow. 

## GH Flow Hands-On

One team member creates a private repo using this template and adds the second team member to the repo as a collaborator.

Now both team members complete the assigned tasks using the following steps:

- Clone the repo from the command line using ```git clone <URL>``` OR Create a new project from version control
- Create a new branch with an appropriate title ```git checkout -b <branch_name>```
- Make changes to your code in the new branch and save them
- Commit your changes from the command line using ```git commit -m "your message here"```
- Push your changes to the remote branch using  ```git push -u origin <branch_name>```
- Create a pull request and assign it to member 2.

Team Member 1 reviews Team Member 2’s PR, merges, deletes branch, and closes the PR. 

Team Member 2 reviews Team Member 1’s PR, and UH OH! Conflict!! Team Member 2 fixes it in R. Merge, delete branch, and close the PR.
